# talks

We want YOU to come talk or present at a future charmCityJS event! (Seriously, we want you to do it. We'll beg if we have to.) A "talk" can be anything--a walk-through of some code you wrote, a story you want to tell, a project you're working on, some art or a robot or a song or wearable tech or anything you can think of that even remotely relates to JavaScript or the tech community in general, we're all ears!

Talks should be 1-20 minutes long, and our events occur on the first Wednesday of the month starting May 2015 in Baltimore, MD. View our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs) for a list of upcoming events.

**To submit an idea**, copy the below Issue Template, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/charmCityJs/talks/issues/new) and paste it in, filling it out with your details. Doesn't need to be super detailed or formal like an abstract, just casually give us an idea of what you'll talk about. **OK GO!!!**

Not interested in speaking yourself, but have topics you'd like to see covered, or other ideas? Submit a "topic request"!

**To submit a topic request**, copy the below Topic Request Template, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/charmCityJs/talks/issues/new) and paste it in, and add your request. This doesn't have to be elaborate, but try not to be overly vague in your request. **HAVE AT IT!!!**

> _Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/gBCRtIiyMH_

## Talk Proposal Template

_Copy the below template and paste into a [new issue](https://github.com/charmCityJs/talks/issues/new)_

**Your name:** Jamie Personface

**Your idea:** I'm thinking about presenting this cool todo app I built, using a mash-up of 35 different JS frameworks to maximize the real-time potential of the semantic web. I'll walk everyone through how I used gulp-grunt-broccoli to build it and then show them a quick demo of some of the awesome shadow DOM things it can do.

**Approx length:** (keep this number betweeen 1 and 20 minutes, please)

**Month(s) available:** Feburary or June

_This could be a single month, a list of upcoming months, or you can leave it off if you want us to work it out with you, no pressure._

## Topic Request Template

_Note: the title of the issue should start with "Request: " and then the actual topic request. Copy the below template and paste it into a [new issue](https://github.com/charmCityJs/talks/issues/new)_

**Your name:** Dale Doback

**Your topic request:** I'd really like to learn how to properly use Grunt in my development workflow so I have more time to do karate in the garage.
