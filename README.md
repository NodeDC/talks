# talks

Come present at a NodeDC meetup! Share some code you wrote, tell us a story, show off a project you're working on, it's all fair game.

Talks can be between 5-60 minutes long, and our events occur on the third Thursday of the month. Check our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc) for a list of upcoming events.

**To submit an idea**, copy the below Issue Template, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks/issues/new) and paste it in, filling it out with your details. Doesn't need to be super detailed, just give us an idea of what you'll talk about. 

Not interested in speaking yourself, but have topics you'd like to see covered? Submit a "topic request"!

**To submit a topic request**, copy the below Topic Request Template, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks/issues/new) and paste it in, and add your request. This doesn't have to be elaborate, but try not to be overly vague in your request.

> _Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/gBCRtIiyMH_

## Talk Proposal Template

_Copy the below template and paste into a [new issue](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks/issues/new)_

**Your name:** Jamie Personface

**Your idea:** I'm thinking about presenting this cool todo app I built, using a mash-up of 35 different JS frameworks to maximize the real-time potential of the semantic web. I'll walk everyone through how I used gulp-grunt-broccoli to build it and then show them a quick demo of some of the awesome shadow DOM things it can do.

**Approx length:** (keep this number betweeen 1 and 20 minutes, please)

## Topic Request Template

_Note: the title of the issue should start with "Request: " and then the actual topic request. Copy the below template and paste it into a [new issue](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks/issues/new)_

**Your name:** Dale Doback

**Your topic request:** I'd really like to learn how to properly use Grunt in my development workflow so I have more time to do karate in the garage.
