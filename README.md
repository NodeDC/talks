# talks

Come present at a NodeDC meetup! Share some code you wrote, tell us a story, show off a project you're working on, it's all fair game.

Talks should be around 20-60 minutes long (but we're flexible on this), and our events occur on the third Thursday of the month. Check our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc) for a list of upcoming events.

**To submit an idea**, [create a new issue](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks/issues/new), and fill out the pre-filled Talk Proposal Template with your details. It doesn't need to be super detailed, just give us an idea of what you'll talk about.

Not interested in speaking yourself but have topics you'd like to see covered? Submit a "topic request"!

**To submit a topic request**, [create a new issue](https://github.com/NodeDC/talks/issues/new), and fill out the pre-filled Topic Request Template. This doesn't have to be elaborate, but try not to be overly vague in your request.

> _Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/33pTvtzLlJMiziDq1_
