## Talk Proposal Template

**Your name:** Jamie Personface

**Your idea:** I'm thinking about presenting this cool todo app I built, using a mash-up of 35 different JS frameworks to maximize the real-time potential of the semantic web. I'll walk everyone through how I used gulp-grunt-broccoli to build it and then show them a quick demo of some of the awesome shadow DOM things it can do.

**Approx length:** (keep this number betweeen 1 and 20 minutes, please)

## Topic Request Template

**Your name:** Dale Doback

**Your topic request:** I'd really like to learn how to properly use Grunt in my development workflow so I have more time to do karate in the garage.
